## Setup Instructions
To get started with CAPTCHA Solver, follow these instructions:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/captcha-solver.git
   cd captcha-solver
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure settings:**
   - Update configuration files as needed for the specific types of CAPTCHAs you wish to solve.

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python captcha_solver.py
   ```

## Usage
To solve a CAPTCHA, you can use the command-line interface or the API. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use the CLI:

```bash
python captcha_solver.py --image <path_to_captcha_image>
```
Replace `<path_to_captcha_image>` with the path to the CAPTCHA image you want to solve. The response will include the solution along with a confidence score.

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [docs](docs/USAGE.md).

## Code Explanation
The code base is structured for clarity and maintainability. The main components include:

- **`solver.py`**: Core logic that implements the algorithms for solving different types of CAPTCHAs.
- **`utils.py`**: Helper functions for image processing and other utility tasks.
- **`api.py`**: Contains the RESTful API endpoints for integration with other applications.
- **`tests.py`**: Comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability and performance of the solver.
