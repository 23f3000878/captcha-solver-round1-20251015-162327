# Captcha Solver

## Project Description
Captcha Solver is a simple application designed to automate the solving of typical captchas. This project aims to provide a basic understanding of captcha challenges and demonstrate how to programmatically approach their resolution. 

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple GUI for easy interaction.
- **Multiple Captcha Types**: Supports standard captcha formats.
- **Real-Time Solutions**: Provides immediate responses for solved captchas.
- **Extensible Codebase**: Designed for easy addition of new captcha solving methods.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the Captcha Solver on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/captcha-solver.git
   cd captcha-solver
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

1. Start the application.
2. Upload a captcha image using the provided interface.
3. Click the "Solve Captcha" button.
4. View the results displayed on the screen.

## Code Explanation
The Captcha Solver utilizes image processing techniques combined with machine learning models to identify and decode captcha challenges. The application is structured in a modular way, separating the logic for image handling, captcha recognition, and user interface. 
- **Main Module**: Handles application execution and GUI.
- **Image Processing**: Utilizes libraries like `Pillow` for image manipulation.
- **Recognition Engine**: Implements OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques to solve captchas.
